Rbs Technical Test 
---------------------

Create API endpoints to get Prime numbers  

Usage: Run the main Application class (from within your IDE) Or execute ```gradle bootRun```

Testing the app: execute ```gradle test```

The application was tested with large input integers to see how it performed with no real performance enhancements. Beyond 10m the slowness became more than 5s so for this reason a hard limit, for input values, of 10m was introduced.

I have not taken into account any other type of performance related issues.
